# Short O.D.D. description of the COMOKIT model

We describe in this document the COMOKIT model using the standard O.D.D. protocol in its first review version.

## Overview 
### Purpose

This model aims at simulating and comparing the application of COVID-19 spread mitigation policies at the scale of a closed commune, the transmission of the disease being modeled at the individual scale. Its purpose is to support deciders and researchers in answering questions such as: Is the containment of a neighborhood more effective than that of an entire village? Does closing schools decrease the transmission peaks ? How does wearing masks impact the dynamics of the epidemy ? How long should a lockdown ideally last ? What proportion of the population should be allowed to undertake activities during a lockdown ?

Several case studies are provided with the model: two Vietnamese communes of Son Loi (Vinh Phuc, Vietnam) and Thua Duc (Ben Tre, Vietnam); the small town of Castanet Tolosan (near Toulouse, France); and one abstract data sample.

Beyond these case studies, the model has been designed as a framework generic enough to be applied to any case study as long as the correct input data is provided. In particular, there is a template model ready to be re-used to start applying COMOKIT on a new set of data (see more in [link to the A to Z])

### Entities, state variables, and scales
#### Scales
The core entity of the model is the `Individual` agents (or species): it represents individual inhabitants of the commune with their individual characteristics (age, sex, employment status) and their epidemiological status and related variables. They perform their daily activities depending on their personal agenda. This agenda is a generated set of `Activity` that can be shared by several individuals (e.g. going to a restaurant with some friends), depending on the age and family status of the `Individual` agent. `Individual` agentsâ€™ attributes include their relatives (i.e. the household), their friends , their colleagues (or classmates) and their home, working place and school `Building`.
