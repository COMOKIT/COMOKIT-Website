COMOKIT is a fairly complex integrated model that combines several specialized sub-models (transmission, activities, epidemiology, etc.). It is fully described in the form of an O.D.D. document that can be downloaded [here](https://comokit.org/ressources/ODD-COMOKIT_v1.pdf), but this description does not concern the operational aspects of installation, initialization, parameterization and extension of COMOKIT, which are covered by this online documentation. 

- [Getting started](gettingStarted) covers downloading, installing and launching the all-in-one version of COMOKIT (or importing COMOKIT into an existing [GAMA](http://gama-platform.org) installation) and executing predefined experiments. 
- [Headless execution](headless) explains how to run experiments without graphical outputs, for example on an HPC infrastructure. 
- [Parameterizing simulations](parameterize) explains how to modify the input parameters used by the different sub-models. 
- [Extending COMOKIT](setupYourOwn) covers how to prepare datasets so that COMOKIT can be applied to new case studies, and how to define new experiments 

If you run into any trouble using GAMA, please do refer to th [official GAMA documentation](https://gama-platform.github.io/wiki/PlatformDocumentation)
