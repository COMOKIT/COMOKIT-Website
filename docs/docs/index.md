# COMOKIT Documentation
{: .no_toc }

COMOKIT is a fairly complex integrated model that combines several specialized sub-models (transmission, activities, epidemiology, etc.). It is fully described in the form of an O.D.D. document that can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/COMOKIT/COMOKIT-Website/raw/master/ressources/ODD-COMOKIT_v1.pdf), but this description does not concern the operational aspects of installation, initialization, parameterization and extension of COMOKIT, which are covered by this online documentation. 
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

- [Getting Started](gettingStarted) covers either downloading, installing and launching the all-in-one version of COMOKIT or importing COMOKIT into an existing [GAMA](http://gama-platform.org) installation.
