COMOKIT is a complex integrated model that combines several specialized sub-models (transmission, activities, epidemiology, etc.). It is fully described in the form of an O.D.D. document that can be downloaded [here](https://comokit.org/ressources/ODD-COMOKIT_v1.pdf), but this description does not concern the operational aspects of installation, initialization, parameterization and extension of COMOKIT, which are covered by this online documentation. 

- [Getting started](gettingStarted) covers downloading, installing and launching the all-in-one version of COMOKIT (or importing COMOKIT into an existing [GAMA](http://gama-platform.org) installation) and executing predefined experiments. 
- [Headless execution](headless) explains how to run experiments without graphical outputs, for example on an HPC infrastructure. 
- [Parameterizing simulations](parameterize) explains how to modify the input parameters used by the different sub-models. 
- [Extending COMOKIT](setupYourOwn) covers how to prepare datasets so that COMOKIT can be applied to new case studies, and how to define new experiments 

Please also refer to the [official GAMA documentation](https://gama-platform.github.io/wiki/PlatformDocumentation) for all matters related to the operation of the platform.
