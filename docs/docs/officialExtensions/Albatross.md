# COMOKIT Albatross (C-Albatross)

COMOKIT Albatross is a dedicated version of COMOKIT to simulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 at the scall of the Netherland with the support 
for Albatross pre-generated mobility agenda. The daily activities are modeled at the minute wide step, changing default COMOKIT behavior at the one hour 
temporal scall. Epidemiological dynamic have been modified as well to account for the larger atomic spatial unit, which is buildings block rather than building.
The upscall spatial resolution makes it possible to simulate wider region, and fits the required spatial distribution of activities as modeled using Albatross agenda generator.

# C-Albatross : extends activity behavior in COMOKIT

## Reading agenda generated by the third party software Albatross

TODO

## Upscalling daily activity location

# C-Albatross : revised epidemiological dynamic

## Replace COMOKIT epidemiological dynamic with custom functions

# C-Albatross : preliminary results
