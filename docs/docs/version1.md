In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, public health authorities around the world have experimented, in a short period of time, with various combinations of interventions at different scales. However, as the pandemic continues to progress, there is a growing need for tools and methodologies to quickly analyze the impact of these interventions and answer concrete questions regarding their effectiveness, range and temporality.

**COMOKIT**, the COVID-19 modeling kit, is such a tool. It is a computer model that allows intervention strategies to be explored _in silico_ before their possible implementation phase. It can take into account important dimensions of policy actions, such as the heterogeneity of individual responses or the spatial aspect of containment strategies. 

In **COMOKIT**, built using the agent-based [modeling and simulation platform GAMA](http://gama-platform.org), the profiles, activities and interactions of people, person-to-person and environmental transmissions, individual clinical statuses, public health policies and interventions are explicitly represented and they all serve as a basis for describing the dynamics of the epidemic in a detailed and realistic representation of space. 

Relying on sub-models that have been extensively tested, spatial and social data that can be collected easily and quickly, **COMOKIT** has been designed from the ground up to be generic, scalable and portable in a variety of social, epidemiological, economic, and geographical scenarios. As a consequence, it is highly configurable and extendable to new case studies.

An [all-in-one distribution of **COMOKIT** V1.0](https://github.com/COMOKIT/COMOKIT-Model/releases/tag/v1.0) (comprising a Java Virtual Machine, GAMA 1.8 and **COMOKIT** itself), together with a [comprehensive set of guidelines and documentation](https://comokit.org/docs/), allows first-time users of GAMA to quickly experiment with the model and build their own extensions or applications in a matter of minutes. Advanced GAMA users can download and import the model from its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/COMOKIT/COMOKIT-Model). Additional datasets are available in a [separate repository](https://github.com/COMOKIT/COMOKIT-Datasets).

We'd love to hear from you ! Enquiries, requests but also information on the models you are developing with **COMOKIT** can be sent to contact@comokit.org. Finally, issues you might have with the model can be reported [here](https://github.com/COMOKIT/COMOKIT-Model/issues).
